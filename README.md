# School Records based on Hyperledger Fabric
## Introduction
Apart from the security concerns, there are additional challenges related to secondary authentication and reliable storage of revision history, which can lead to increased costs. Additionally, the current system for accessing student transcripts can be time-consuming and inefficient for students.
To address these issues, implementing the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain can provide a solution. This permissioned blockchain technology allows for restricted access to authorized users, simplifies secondary authentication, and ensures data integrity through distributed storage of student records. By utilizing blockchain, students can access their documents more quickly and have greater control over their personal information. This solution also mitigates the risk of arbitrary data forgery and tampering.

This project will provide the following benefits:
1.	Secure and efficient way to manage requesting school transcript records
2.	Tamper-evident and transparent way to store and share student transcript between different education institutions
3.	Reduced administrative burden and improved data accuracy
4.	Enhanced data privacy and confidentiality
5.	Improved regulatory compliance
